For our Capstone Project, my group and I made a data warehouse to store the results of API calls to concert ticket vendors in an effort to build a classification model to predict the availability of the ticket listing the following day.

Topics explored included:

- API calls
	* TicketMaster
	* StubHub
	* SeatGeek
	* Spotify

- Data Engineering
	* S3
	* Redshift
	* EC2
	* Automated Scheduling

- Machine Learning
	* EDA
	* Feature Engineering
	* Imbalanced Classification
	* Bayesian Decision Boundaries
	* AUC
	* Logistic Regression
	* Regularization
	* Train-Test-Split
	* Cross-Validation
	* Discriminant Analysis
	* Support Vector Machines
	* Naive Bayes
	* Random Forests
	* Gradient Boosting Machines
	* Feature Importance
	* Ensembling
	* Custom Loss Score Matrix
	* Recursive Binary Search Algorithm
